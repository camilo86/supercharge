## How to use

To run a command in VSCode:

1. Open command palette by going to `View > Command Palette` or by using the keyboard shortcut `CTRL+SHIFT+P`
2. Type the supercharge command you would like to run.
    - Supercharge commands starts with `supercharge:` prefix, for example `supercharge: Decode base64`.
3. Profit

**Pro tip:** Many commands can be run inline (text selection). So for example, say have a long string in a document that you would like to encode in base64; you could select such text, open the command pallete, and run the `supercharge: Encode base64`. This will replace the selected text with its base64 representation. By the way, this works for multiple text selections as well!
